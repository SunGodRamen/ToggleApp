AutoHotkey App Toggler

Overview
This script provides a way to open, close, or toggle focus to different applications using predefined hotkeys. The script reads from a configuration file (app_hotkeys.ini) where you can define your preferred hotkeys and the corresponding applications.

Configuration File Format (app_hotkeys.ini)
The configuration file should contain key-value pairs structured as follows:

```
^!v:Code.exe,ahk_exe Code.exe
^!c:chrome.exe,ahk_exe chrome.exe ahk_class Chrome_WidgetWin_1
```

Each line consists of three parts:

The hotkey that will be used to toggle the application. This is specified before the colon (:). In the examples above, ^!v and ^!c are the hotkeys (representing Ctrl + Alt + V and Ctrl + Alt + C, respectively).
The process name of the application, which is specified after the colon and before the comma.
The query that AutoHotkey uses to identify the application's window(s). This is specified after the comma.
Usage
Press the defined hotkey to toggle the associated application. The behavior is as follows:

If the application isn't running, it will start.
If the application is running and the window is active, it will minimize.
If the application is running and the window is not active, it will be brought to focus.
Portability
This script can be compiled into an executable file using the AutoHotkey compiler (Ahk2Exe). This makes it portable, allowing you to use the functionality on any Windows machine without needing to install AutoHotkey.

Note
Please be aware that the compiled executable does not completely hide your source code. It can still be decompiled. If you need to distribute your script without exposing your source code, you might need to consider using another language that compiles to machine code.
